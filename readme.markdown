### Authors and Contributors
This widget is a fork from @ruanmer's <a href="https://github.com/ruanmer/Github-Widget">original Github-Widget</a>.  Apparently it is also based off @markdotto's <a href="https://github.com/markdotto/github-buttons">GitHub-Buttons</a>.  Additionally it relies on the GitHub API, so thanks to everyone involved on that.
