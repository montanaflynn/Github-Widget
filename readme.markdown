Want to share your repo's and activity on your blog or portfolio? This simple widget allows you to embed an iframe widget that pulls from a specific account and repo on Github.  

### Get Started
All you have to do is download this repo and modify the iframe found in example.html with the username and repo you want the widget to load:  

##### From command line:
```
$ cd /where/you/want/your/repo/
$ git clone git@github.com:montanaflynn/Github-Widget.git
$ nano Github-Widget/example.html
```

##### Not a Command Line Ninja? Try this:
First <a href="https://github.com/montanaflynn/Github-Widget/zipball/master">download the widget files</a> and extract them.  Now open example.html and change the iframe url to include your username and repo. 

### Coming Soon
Multiple Repo Support, 
jQuery Plugin ( No iFrame ), 
More Themes

### Authors and Contributors
This widget is a fork from @ruanmer's <a href="https://github.com/ruanmer/Github-Widget">original Github-Widget</a>.  Apparently it is also based off @markdotto's <a href="https://github.com/markdotto/github-buttons">GitHub-Buttons</a>.  Additionally it relies on the GitHub API, so thanks to everyone involved on that.
